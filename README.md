I made this repository with the intention that, when it is necessary to use themes, this repository can be consulted for any doubts, or as a starting point for a new project. Therefore, I decided to make it public so that anyone else can also study it and even suggest improvements


Resume:

Using context API, I created a default theme that can be customized to meet the needs of different projects, using a default configuration to create 'complete' themes. This context consumes the default theme coming from the 'Styled components' lib and passes it to the children, so it is used normally. With the difference that this default theme can be changed programmatically

If you want to test, clone this project, run `yarn install` to install all project depedencies, after this run `yarn start`. And modify, learn, and play however you like with the View.
